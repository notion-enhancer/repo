# notion-enhancer/repo

The collection of mods run by the notion-enhancer (v0.11.0).

This repo trialled splitting up the project into submodules that could then be combined with alternate "cores" to enable cross-platform development. An auto-update system pushed commits from these submodules to the parent repositories' in an attempt to keep everything in sync, however, this made conflict-free contributions and setting up local development environments complicated. This repo has now been archived with the return of the notion-enhancer to a monorepo (https://github.com/notion-enhancer/notion-enhancer).
